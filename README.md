# 2048-PYTHON
This code implements a basic version of the 2048 game using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. Class Definitions:
   - Board: Manages the game board, including cell colors, grid updates, and the game state. It handles:
     - Grid setup and cell merging.
     - Randomly placing new cells.
     - Checking if moves are possible or if the game is over.
     - Drawing the grid on the screen.
   - **`Game`**: Handles game logic and user input:
     - Starts the game and initializes two random cells.
     - Responds to arrow key presses to move tiles and update the grid.
     - Checks for winning or losing conditions and displays messages accordingly.

2. Game Mechanics:
   - **Movement**: The grid can be shifted up, down, left, or right. Cells are compressed and merged as per the game's rules.
   - **Winning Condition**: The game checks for the presence of the 2048 tile to declare victory.
   - **Game Over Condition**: The game checks if there are no possible moves left and displays a game-over message.

3. UI and Controls:
   - The game is controlled using the arrow keys, and the board updates dynamically based on user input.
   - The game displays the score and updates the board in real-time.
